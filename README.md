# Static Site Demo

This project was inspired by the Week 1 project madate from Founders and Coders. The actual project asks the team to create a one page website for themselves, and as I already have a personal website, I modified the aim to produce a one page website for fictional clients (classical musicians) looking to hire developers to build a website.

**Purpose**

This project follows the guidance on FAC's Week 1 project brief in order to
learn to build a one-page website.

**What is this site about**

This site assumes that I am part of a team of developers who are promoting and
educators (e.g. music teachers).

The site aims to allow potential clients to do the following:

1. See a navigation bar for About and contact
2. Be able to see what the developers do (i.e. About)
3. Contact the developers via a form
4. Navigate around the site without having to leave the page
5. View the page responsively

**How this site was built**

This site is modelled after one-page sites built on GitHub pages that contain
elements and style that I wanted to include. By observing the code of these
existing sites, I learned what the block did and modified the details for the
components that I have chosen to include on this site.

Where relevant, I also tried to improve upon the code from my reference materials
(e.g. improving semantics using HTML5).
